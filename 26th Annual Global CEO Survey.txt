Today’s tensions
How much is your mood today affecting your view of tomorrow?
Most CEOs highlight their concerns over the world economy. About 78% of India CEOs,
73% of global CEOs and 69% of Asia Pacific CEOs believe that global economic growth will
decline over the next 12 months.
But our survey also indicates that despite the gloomy global outlook, India CEOs are hopeful
about the country’s economic growth: More than five in ten CEOs (57%) express optimism
about India’s economy over the next 12 months. In comparison, only 37% of Asia Pacific
CEOs and 29% of global CEOs expect economic growth to improve in their countries or
regions over the next 12 months.

The responses of India CEOs mark a dramatic shift from the mood in 2021, when 99% said
India’s economic growth would improve over the next 12 months. The reasons are not far to
seek. When the 25th Annual Global CEO Survey was being conducted in October–November
2021, it seemed the worst of the pandemic was over. But within weeks of fieldwork closing,
news of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 broke out. When the
present survey was conducted in 2022, the world was already reeling under the impact of the
conflict in Europe and other macroeconomic issues.

The next steps
While it may be good to err on the side of caution, it is important that CEOs stay optimistic
about the future. What is needed then is:
.an approach to combat bias in the boardroom by soliciting views through independent
consultation or questionnaires
.discussions that are structured to consider overlooked possibilities
.assigning a devil’s advocate role for critical discussions.
How do your resilience and workforce strategies fit together?
The survey makes it clear that measures are being taken, or being planned, to meet the
challenges of the future. Cost cuts are high on the priority list everywhere, with about 93% of
India CEOs saying that they are cutting, have cut or are considering cutting operating costs
and spurring revenue growth to mitigate economic challenges and volatility. About 85%,
however, stress they will not reduce the size of their workforce, and 96% state they do not
plan to reduce compensation – demonstrating their resolve to retain talent.

Employee attrition is another issue that confronts CEOs. The survey shows that India CEOs
are divided, with 32% saying attrition rates will continue to increase slightly, moderately and
significantly, and 34% holding that there will be no change. But this may be a bigger concern
than is now being felt.
